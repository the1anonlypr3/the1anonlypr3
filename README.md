</--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\>

i am [REDACTED], better known as _pr3_, and you should expect quite a vast range of things from me as i venture into the vast world that is tech.
  from my account, you _could_ see:
  - animations (specifically for the Flipper Zero)
  - Website(s) with HTML/CSS
  - A plethora of (probably useless) programs made with C, python, or some other language i decide to randomly learn at 3am on a tuesday
  - Scripts (if i decide to learn javascript/duckyscript/ps!)
        //subject to change as i broaden my horizon(s)

</--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\>

about me:
    - needless to say i adore tech. (duhh...)
    - i do everything you may see from a terrible HP laptop that's seen several Kali installs, and unfathomable bluescreens
    - i love linux, but use windows (fed?)
    - 'spose i'm somewhat of a hacker
    - born in upsidedownland, still live there
    - you can definitely find me in the Flipper OFW, MNTM, and TalkingSasquach's discords
    - i'm constantly learning! meaning i'm okay at everything sorta, but i don't quite have a complete understanding of code, hardware, etc.
    
</--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\>

my socials are:
  - Discord:
      "pr3." (not to be confused with the mysterious siege hacker, i swear people add me instead of him so much ffs)
  - nothing else i'm willing to link, again subject to change maybe

</--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\>

inspirations to me:
 - enough talk about myself, time to link some other people that you, the sole person reading this, should undoubtably check out. (they also helped me a lot/i use their stuff!)
         (in no specific order!:)
     Entitate: [zero socials i can link]

     // it's been a pleasure to talk to all of these people/use their software or firmware, no matter how meaningful said usage/interaction was.

   All of the Yapps (all of the Yapps)
(Yapps, Yapps) All of the Yapps
Turn up the Yapps in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the Yapps in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the Yapps
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the Yapps, all of the Yapps
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (all of the Yapps)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university
Yapps
Cop Yapps, flashYapps, spotYapps
Strobe Yapps, street Yapps
(All of the Yapps, all of the Yapps)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (all of the Yapps)
Turn up the Yapps in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the Yapps in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the Yapps
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Them courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university
Yapps
Cop Yapps, flashYapps, spotYapps
Strobe Yapps, street Yapps
(All of the Yapps, all of the Yapps)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (all of the Yapps)
Turn up the Yapps in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the Yapps in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the Yapps
I'm gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get your own
I'm gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get your own
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind? (My mind, my mind, my mind)
And also was about to do that line (line, line, line)
'Kay, okay, you know we going all the way this time (time)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
Turn up the Yapps in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the Yapps in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the Yapps
Whoa, whoa, oh
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was, oh)
Whoa, whoa, oh
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was, oh)
Whoa, whoa, oh
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was, oh)
Whoa, whoa, oh
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say)
