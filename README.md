// **WELCOME TO MY README!** \\
<br></--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\>

i am [REDACTED], better known as _pr3_, and you should expect quite a vast range of things from me as i venture into the vast world that is tech.
  from my account, you _could_ see:
  - animations (specifically for the Flipper Zero)
  - Website(s) with HTML/CSS
  - A plethora of (probably useless) programs made with C, python, or some other language i decide to randomly learn at 3am on a tuesday
  - Scripts (if i decide to learn javascript/duckyscript/ps!)
        //subject to change as i broaden my horizon(s)

</--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\>

about me:
    <br>- needless to say i adore tech. (duhh...)
    <br>- i do everything you may see from a terrible HP laptop that's seen several Kali installs, and unfathomable bluescreens
    <br>- i love linux, but use windows (fed?)
    <br>- 'spose i'm somewhat of a hacker
    <br>- born in upsidedownland, still live there
    <br>- you can definitely find me in the Flipper OFW, MNTM, and TalkingSasquach's discords
    <br>- i'm constantly learning! meaning i'm okay at everything sorta, but i don't quite have a complete understanding of code, hardware, etc.
    
</--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\>

my socials are:
  - Discord:
      <br>"pr3." (not to be confused with the mysterious siege hacker, i swear people add me instead of him so much ffs)
  - nothing else i'm willing to link, again subject to change maybe

</--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\>

inspirations to me:
 <br>- enough talk about myself, time to link some other people that you, the sole person reading this, should undoubtably check out. (they also helped me a lot/i use their stuff!)
         <br>(in no specific order!:)
